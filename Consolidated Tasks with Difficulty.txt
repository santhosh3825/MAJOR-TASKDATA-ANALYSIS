    6. **Identify any potential outliers in the 'Profit' column using box plots.**

* **Advanced:**
    1. Use a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. 
    2. Perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews (if available) to identify areas for improvement. 
    3. Develop a predictive model to forecast monthly sales for the next 12 months using aggregated sales data instead of individual transactions. 
    4. Perform feature engineering to create new variables for predicting order cancellation probabilities. 
    5. Create an interactive visualization to analyze customer retention rates by cohorts. 
    6. **Build a decision tree model to predict which customers are most likely to make a repeat purchase.**

**For Power BI**

* **Basic:**
    1. Create a map visualization to show the geographic distribution of customers. 
    2. Create a bar chart to visualize the top 10 selling products. 
    3. Create a pie chart visualizing payment methods used across all orders. 
    4. Create a line chart showing the trend of total orders per month for each year. 
    5. Design a dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, number of orders, and average order value. 
    6. **Create a bar chart to show the top 5 customers by total sales amount.**

* **Intermediate:**
    1. Build an interactive dashboard to filter sales by state, city, and product category. 
    2. Create a visualization of freight value contribution to total costs for different sellers. 
    3. Build a stacked bar chart of revenue by product category for each state. 
    4. Design a funnel chart to visualize the order-to-delivery process and identify potential bottlenecks. 
    5. Develop a dashboard to analyze monthly retention rates for customer cohorts. 
    6. **Create a dashboard to compare the sales performance of different sales channels (if available).**

* **Advanced:**
    1. Create a dashboard to display seller performance (e.g., revenue, average delivery time, review scores). 
    2. Build a time-series forecasting dashboard for monthly sales predictions. 
    3. Visualize the impact of reviews on product sales using scatter plots and trend lines. 
    4. Develop a dashboard to explore product profitability by category and seller. 
    5. Design a dashboard to analyze customer segmentation based on their purchase history and demographics. 
    6. **Create a dashboard that allows users to interactively explore the relationship between customer demographics and purchase behavior.**

I've added a few more challenging tasks to each level for all three tools, making the list more comprehensive. I hope this enhanced version is even more helpful!

Thank you for sharing the dataset! Based on the provided columns and existing visualizations, here are some additional business requirements and tasks for generating insightful Tableau visualizations:
